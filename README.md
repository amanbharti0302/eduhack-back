</br>



Nowadays everything is pushed to online due to ongoing pandemic including education. All schools and colleges are conducting their classes as well as examinations online.
Since, examinations are being held online, there is no one to monitor the students in their semester or term examinations. They copy stuffs from internet and exchange their 
answers online very easily. It‚Äôs very difficult for the professors to grade the students since all the students write the answers correctly. Professors have to put some random 
grades based on figures, handwritings and other irrelevant stuffs. As a result, there is a possibility that students who copied from others might get better grade than the 
student who actually wrote it all by himself. So, we build a web application that acts as a communication system between the students and professors through which he can detect 
plagiarism. It will instantly show if students has copied things from internet.  It also shows forged clustering that is clusters of students who copied from another.<br/>

Idea:üòé</br>
An online platform for Students and Professors for conducting online written examinations with following features:</br>
-Plagiarism detection</br>
-Tasks can be assigned to students by professors and former‚Äôs submission can be viewed.</br>
-Tracks subject-wise marks and previously submitted assignments.</br>
-Separate portals and dashboards for students and professors.</br></br>

Tech Stack used:üßê</br>
MERN(MongoDB,Express.js, React.js,Node.js)</br>
Python for plagiarism detection.</br>
