distance_threshold is sensitive to the data feeded.
=> it is dependent on the total no. of distinct words;
=> hence, a data with different texts will have high threshold compared to a data with similar texts.

The plagiarism part may take high amout of time if feeded a huge paragraph, hence, optimise the code.
